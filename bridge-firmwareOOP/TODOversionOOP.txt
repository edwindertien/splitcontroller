TODO:

What is the meaning of:
  boolean L1state, R1state, R2state, L2state, Rreleased;

Why int, what does this do? (name suggests boolean, because 'released' can be either true or false):
  int LeftReleased, RightReleased;

Rename elements of m_PWMpins:
  e.g. "PWM1" doesn't say anything about what is connected to this pin. Couldn't derive this from original code yet.

Check OOP validation:
  switch 'Mode' in class?

int directionA  in case GREEN bij LeftMode, does A mean 'left'?

void init() {
  Wire.setClock(10000) ;
  pinMode(20, INPUT_PULLUP);
  pinMode(21, INPUT_PULLUP);

  what are pin # 20 and 21 for?


// I don't understand the one below. accy > center MINUS margin and accy < center PLUS margin?

(accx[1] > CENTER + MARGIN && accy[1] > CENTER - MARGIN && accy[1] < CENTER + MARGIN)



// below: 'else' can be removed? (LeftMode GREEN)
int directionB = -1;
......
} else {    // can be removed because directionB = -1 from line 289?
  directionB = -1;
}
