TODO:

What is the meaning of:
  boolean L1state, R1state, R2state, L2state, Rreleased;

Why int, what does this do? (name suggests boolean):
  int LeftReleased, RightReleased;

Rename elements of m_PWMpins:
  e.g. "PWM1" doesn't say anything about what is connected to this pin. Couldn't derive this from original code yet.

Check OOP validation:
  switch Mode in class?

Check whether this is even used:
  std::map<std::string,uint8_t>::iterator it; (around line 115)
